              Several changes have been made that will greatly improve the
              performance and reliability of the application. A full update
              release will be coming soon with a more automated upgrade process,
              but I am embedding this quick guide in the meantime for any early
              adopters.

              There are two major changes in the database that will require some
              quick manual action to transform your existing data.

                Visit the settings page to set your retention preferences. The
                database is wildly faster now and can handle a very large number
                of records. You will likely want to increase your max records
                value. I am setting the default for new users at 100 thousand.
